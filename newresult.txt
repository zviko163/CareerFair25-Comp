Java provides a wrapper class Character in java.lang package. 
An object of type Character contains a single field, whose type is char. 
The Character class offers a number of useful class (i.e., static) methods for manipulating characters. 
You can create a Character object with the Character constructor. 

Creating a Character object: 

The above statement creates a Character object which contains ‘a’ of type char. 
There is only one constructor in the Character class that expects an argument of char data type. 

If we pass a primitive char into a method that expects an object, the compiler automatically converts the char to a Character class object. 
This feature is called Autoboxing and Unboxing.
